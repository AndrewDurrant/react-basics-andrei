**Notes For React Basics**

USE REACT DOCS OFTEN
- Babel: takes files and make sure js file will work on all browsers old and new
- Web Pack: Module bundler. Takes all of our js and optimizes it for production.  

- super(), a method from React.Component is what calls the React.Component's constructor.

- SyntheticEvent: look this up in react docs
